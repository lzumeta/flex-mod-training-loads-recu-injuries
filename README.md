# README

This is the accompanying code repository for the manuscript 

"Flexible modelling of time-varying exposures and recurrent events to analyze training loads and injuries"


**To reproduce the results presented in the maunscript, run the file in `rerun-analysis.R` (it is not necessary to run the first script `preproc-data.R`, as the resulting data is already contained within this repository. The original, uprocessed SAS data bases could not be shared.)

Note that this could take some time (and computational ressources). Optionally,
you can run the individual lines of code in `rerun-analysis.R` sequentially and restart your R session in between.**
